# Gb3Poc

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

## Installation

- Husky

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also
use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out

## Docker

### Building the image

The docker image has to be built for each environment separately, since we cannot use runtime environment
configurations.

In order to build the docker image use the following command (adjust tag as needed):

```
docker build --build-arg TARGET_ENVIRONMENT={target_environment} --t gb3-frontend:latest .
```

- **gb3-frontend** is the name of the image
- **latest** is the tag used to mark the version of this image
- **target_environment** is the target build environment, which is one of the following:
  - `local`: Default if this variable is missing; localhost development
  - `local-gb2`: localhost development with locally deployed GB2 backend
  - `dev-ebp`: production deployment for EBP environment
  - `staging`: production deployment for KTZH staging environment
  - `uat`: production deployment for KTZH UAT environment
  - `production`: production deployment for KTZH production (internet & intranet) environment

The `target_environment` is used to create environment specific build outputs so as to not divulge sensitive information
such as internal domains. This is mainly reflected in the runtime configuration mechanism described below.

### Run the image

This image exposes port 8080 and can be run like this:

```
docker run -p 80:8080 gb3-frontend:latest
```

- **80:8080** maps the internal port 8080 to the external port 80; the later can be chosen freely
- **gb3-frontend** is the name of the image
- **latest** is the version tag for this image

## Local Backend

### Using local GB2 setup

If you're using a local GB2 setup (e.g. via docker), you can use this backend by
running `ng serve --configuration=development-local-gb2` (or `npm run start-local-gb2` shorthand). This assumes that

- GB2 runs on localhost, port 3000, exposing **all** services from GB2 (wms, tokens, etc.)
- GB2 is accessible from your host

If using this, angular will proxy all requests to the GB2 via localhost, so you have to set all links to be relative (
e.g. `/wms/asd` will become `http://localhost:4200/wms/asd`, and then proxied to `http://localhost:3000/wms/asd`).

## Code documentation

### Runtime configurations

The app supports multiple environments with different endpoints. Because the production deployment has different
endpoints depending on whether it is access via internet or intranet, these URLs need to be added during runtime, so
Angular's environment files do not work.

As a workaround, the `ConfigService` can be used. This service will check the current hostname and return the given API
configurations. The replacements are done (similar to the environment configurations) as part of the `angular.json`
build file replacements.

The configurations are found in `src/app/shared/configs/runtime.config.ts` and configured via their environment
replacement files.
