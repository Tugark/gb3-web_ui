  Import the Material Icons font explicitly as CSS and not as SCSS.
  This workaround is needed with Angular 17.2.3 due to internal path resolution changes.
  See https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/27256

  As soon as the karma runner moves away from webpack OR the package is updated OR someone has a better fix for this
  issue, we can remove this workaround.
